We are about to enter room 207, patient ID 1128. Good afternoon, my name is Jasmine. I'll be your nurse for this evening. Can you please state your name and your date of birth?

George Murillo and date of birth is September 3rd of 2001.

Do you have any pre-existing allergies or pre-existing medical conditions?

No, that I'm aware of.

And what is your zip code of your residence and the reason that you were admitted?

34771 and I have a big headache.

Okay, I'm going to take your vitals. So your temperature is 97.3, your heart rate is normal, and your blood pressure is 180 over 20. A scale of 1 to 10, what is your pain level for your headache?

7.

Okay, so we're going to prescribe you Tylenol and if that doesn't work, the next shift over will probably prescribe you morphine.
